# fakesh
Lose all your friends by making them think their binaries disappeared LOL

Installation:
use `git` to clone this repo

Running:
`cd fakesh`
`python main.py`

You will be prompted 'cfg' for what you want the program to display as a 'shell' prompt. For example, typing 'user@machine ~ % ' here would result in here would result in prompting the user with:
`user@machine ~ %` .

You will then be prompted 'sh_choice' for what shell the program is to say errors as. For example, typing 'zsh' here would result in it answering any prompts with:
`zsh: command not found: ' followed by whatever the user tried to do.

After you answer the prompts, clear the terminal, and listen from afar as your friend screams in confusion when they see `zsh: command not found: ls`!
